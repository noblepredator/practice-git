In the summer of last year, two Pune scientists, Monali Rahalkar and husband Rahul Bahulikar, wrote a paper titled ‘Lethal Pneumonia Cases in Mojiang Miners (2012) and the Mineshaft Could Provide Important Clues to the Origin of SARS-CoV-2’. The research, first reported by TOI on June 16, 2020, theorised a link between Covid-19 and a pneumonia-like illness that claimed the lives of three miners in China’s Yunnan province. Their probe into the deaths and the bat coronavirus RaTG13, discovered in 2013 and currently the closest known relative of SARS-CoV-2, soon became a key part of investigations by DRASTIC, a group of scientists and analysts looking into the origins of Covid-19. The couple’s work gained momentum after a member of this group - known as ‘The Seeker’ - found other vital information that boosted the ‘lab leak theory’. Rahalkar has hypothesised that the miners’ illness was not transmissible at the time because friends and relatives and others near the mine were not sickened. But after their samples reached
